new feature - make a branch.
pull request from origin master cant be done if you havent finished the modification. Youre just commiting it, youre not pushing it yet.

------
making a push:

git add .

git commit -m ''

git push origin master
------
making a pull is the same:

git add .

git commit -m ''

git pull origin master
